# Recipe Box

Project complete. I initially started this a few months ago when I first started learning React. At this point I begun thinking about how I would implement storing and handling recipes and had no idea, so I put it off for a while. Since then, I've had the privilege of working to rewrite all of our JS at work into React + Redux. As soon as I begun to understand Redux I knew it would be a great way to tackle this, and start getting a bit more experience. I really enjoy working with React and Redux, it feels really good to be able to reason out what you're trying to do and make happen. Redux makes it really easy to figure out where something is going wrong and gives you helpers on how to fix it. Overall, looking forward to doing more React + Redux work soon.

A note on styling: I've been really enjoying looking at brutalist websites lately. I know this doesn't quite fit the bill, but I wanted to see what I could spin up with very few colours, and I think it's an okay concept for a few hours worth of work. It's sort of like "night mode brutalist meets litmus strips". The point of this project was React + Redux, so that's what I wanted to really let shine here.
